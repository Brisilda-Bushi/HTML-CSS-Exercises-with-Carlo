    <h1>Internet</h1>

    <h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5>

    <p>
        The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer
        networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate
        between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of
        private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to
        global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical
        networking technologies.

    <h3>Terminology</h3>

    <p>
        The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or
        interwoven. Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global
        system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to
        any group of smaller networks. When it came into common use, most
        publications treated the word as a capitalized proper noun; this has
        become less common. This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize
        new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar. It is sometimes
        still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller
        networks, though many publications, including the AP Stylebook, recommend
        the lowercase form in every case.

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>
        In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the 
        United States Department of Defense funded research into time-sharing 
        of computers. Research into packet switching, one of the 
        fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran 
        in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965. 
        After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, 
        packet switching from the proposed NPL network was incorporated 
        into the design for the ARPANET and other resource sharing networks 
        such as the Merit Network and CYCLADES, which were developed in the 
        late 1960s and early 1970s.
